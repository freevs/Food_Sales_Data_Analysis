Sales Analysis


Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales management today is the most important function in a commercial and business enterprise.
In this project we will be trying to analyze a food sales dataset with over 65000 records and understand the Sales trend across time, identifying the commodities that are in demand and also giving the stakeholder visual reports to understand all the insights that we gain from the dataset and come up with better decisions to improve the sales model.
